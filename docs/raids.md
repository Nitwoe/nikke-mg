NIKKE Server ranking contents. 

**Solo Raid (SR)** is individual ranking, rewards vary from **gems, doll and cube materials.**Depending on your rank, you can also receive a **frame**. 

**Union Raid (UR)**, your union rank based on the clear time.**Rewards are only union chips** used in the Union Shop.

**Coop **is a cooperative raid with 4 other random players or a mix of your friends and guildies, **rewards **broken cores** used in the Recycling Shop**.**

## Solo Raid


**If you do not see this icon on your main screen, it means there isn’t a Solo Raid ongoing.**



This is a monthly “event”, which will feature a special BOSS (Tyrant-class) Rapture each time. Solo Raid has a total of 7 difficulties, and a challenge mode, each with increased difficulty and rewards.



**You receive 3 entries every day**.**Each entry allows you to utilize up to 5 separate teams to beat the boss. If you can clear all difficulties up to 7, then you don’t need to worry and just clear everything and then quick battle the highest non-challenge mode difficulty on the subsequent days. 



**First difficulty should be easy with synchro 41, and each subsequent difficulty requires 20 synchro levels more than the previous Synchro 160 with one or two level 200 NIKKEs should be enough for difficulty 7 clear.**



The event usually starts from **Thursday, the first week of the month at 12:00 PM UTC+9** (Seoul, Korea time) and lasts for a week, finishing at the next **Thursday at 05:00 AM UTC+9**. The challenge mode opens on the third day, because you only attempt three times a day.



**Solo Raid Team Building**

As mentioned in **Elemental Damage, Elemental Shield**, you have to build a team including at least 1 Nikke is element weakness of the boss, because you will encounter elemental shield. If you ignore the elemental shield, basically the boss will wipe all your Nikke. Even that attack didn’t wipe all your Nikke, you have to destroy it fast because you will deal too little damage and this mode needs you to gain a higher score with your team. 



Building elemental damage is necessary because elemental damage is the main factor to gain a high score.



Keep in mind that you need to learn the gimmick of bosses before building teams, because we don’t know how Shift Up cooking of the boss. You may encounter easy boss that you don’t need healer or you have to encounter hard boss that you need certain weapon / skill to counter boss gimmicks



**Challenge Mode**

The goal is to deal as much damage you can to the boss with 5 separate teams. The level of Nikkes are fixed to level 400 regardless of your current level. The main factor to get a higher score is your NIKKEs investment. 


After you finish attacking with five teams on Challenge Mode, the total score is the same as the total damage dealt by each team combined. It will be put on the leaderboard of each server, and show your rank percentage or position on the top 200. You can brag about it to your friends. Then, you can get gems and frames. The higher score you gain, the more gems you will get, and a better frame.



This is the real Endgame content that Nikke provides for now. Basically, your invested Nikkes are going to be used in Solo Raid Challenge Mode or SP Arena PvP. Pushing hard stages is basically time gated by synchro levels.

## Union Raid


Same as Solo Raid, Union Raid is a monthly event. Your Union will encounter 5 types of Raptures (3 Lord-class, 2 Tyrant-class). These bosses need to be killed 10 times each with all your Union members.



Each member receives 3 attempts per day. You can choose the boss that uses your attempt to attack.



You need to coordinate with your union member to get optimum clear time, something difficult in casual or semi casual unions.



Starts from on the **Friday, third/fourth week of month at 12:00 PM UTC+9** (Korean Time) until **Thursday, a week later at 05:00 AM UTC+9**



This mode is just a speedrun competition if you aim for higher ranks and piloting accounts will be necessary for some Unions, especially competitive ones.

## Coop


Time limited operation, with friends or randoms. Unfortunately, the UI for coop is pretty outdated, and you won’t even see it if you don’t look for it.

It will appear on the cards below your commander icon and on the 



Pretty simple mode, and negligible ranking rewards. Most of the time, you will go AFK and just wait for the battle timer to run out. Simply participating is enough to receive all rewards needed to buy everything on the Recycling Shop.
