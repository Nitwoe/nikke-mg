# Progression Walls


***Made possible thanks to KampretLordz, tio_romano, gatrix, itsmomoland, kisenix, awesome21snake and more!***



**This list will be updated as soon as new chapters are added or early chapters are revisited.**



**Up until chapter 18, borrowed NIKKEs can make the wall stages a joke. And as such, the wall only applies if you want to save the daily usage of them for a later chapter.**



**Criteria:** These stages are either stat walls, manual play required, the raptures are specially difficult to deal with, or a combination of all the previous. Bosses are generally “harder” than normal stages, however some bosses have very specific mechanics, and will hinder your progression by quite some time if you don’t want to learn said mechanics beforehand. 



**Do take note that all stages can be CP crushed, in other words, in a 10% or less CP deficit. This list will obviously not apply if not at least 15% deficit, with very few cases.**



The ones listed in **bold **are the hardest stages among the hard stages.

**List of Raptures that will hinder your progression


Servant Class

Bullwhip (seahorse): seahorse-like rapture, flying afloat on screen. Has a small hitbox so it's hard to aim. Hits you hard without warning

Starfish: Basically Bullwhip but even smaller.

Dagger: throws hitcount black ball. If there are too many, it will overwhelm your Nikke, especially if you don’t bring an MG. Introduced at Chapter 19

Kamikaze: there’s 3 types; Glitter (airborne), Remnant (land-type), and Capsule (airborne, element protected). Jumping to your Nikke, killing themselves. You will not encounter Capsule before chapter 25

Cube (volley): spams volley shots on your Nikke

Drifter: If you ignore, then they will explode. Dealing damage to all Nikke, can’t be dodged. Stuns Attacker Nikke (Supporter and Defender aren't affected). Auto mode ignores them so you have to aim manually.


Elite Class

Bronchus (fart): hit all your Nikkes with radiation attack (players called it farts), cannot be dodged. Overheal solves this attack

Glasses: you need to hit them hundreds of times to break its shield. It heals all raptures when alive. Need MG to kill it. Introduced at chapter 19

Launcher (silencer): it spawns Batteries that silence your Nikke, blocking Nikke abilities to burst. Introduced at chapter 23

Jellyfish: a jellyfish-like rapture as it names, binds 1 your Nikke, debuffs reload speed and slowly kills your Nikke. Introduced at chapter 21

Sentry (chain): bind your Nikke with a chain that stuns your Nikke for a long time if they are not killed. This rapture usually tanky

Barbell: a high defense rapture, Combine with healer it would be the tankiest rapture that you need to encounter, wasting your time. 

Joint (worm/inferno): A worm-like Rapture floating, damaging one Nikke after a long time, like Inferno Tower on Clash of Clans / Clash Royale
