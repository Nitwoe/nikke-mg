# How Deficit Works?
What is stage deficit? It’s a way for the game to artificially block your progress.
Each NIKKE has a certain combat power (CP), based on their: Base stats, level, limit break, affection rank, recycling room bonuses, gear and overload attributes, doll or favorite item level, cube equipped and skill levels. 

Almost every content has a CP requirement:
Story stages, hard mode stages, simulation room, lost sector, towers and PVP. 
Interception, Solo Raid and Union Raid don’t have the requirement on display, but you need fairly good gear and synchro levels to clear them, so let’s say it also has a “requirement”. 

But, why is that important? Your squad total CP vs the stage CP requirement will dictate how much your team stats will get reduced. 
Thanks to Kusanagi, you can use this deficit calculator. 
It shows not only how much deficit you are at, but also the percentage of the reduced stats.
CP update TL/DR:
The CP deficit impact before was way less than now. Rapture’s HP / ATK / DEF remained the same, but how much our stats got reduced changed. The calculation goes as: Before, we had a bigger raw atk number being reduced heavily by the deficit, without OL atk being factored in. This means that at higher deficits we had almost the same final atk or less, but a way higher base atk, since synchro level was way higher. Now, since OL lines change the cp, we have a way lower base atk, but the final atk doesn't get as reduced as before, unless at a super high deficit.

The 48% deficit before, is 39% now. 
It's somewhat harder, and easier to push now. 

This is a example comparison of the same stage requirement before/after
before the update: 10.000 base atk, at 43%~ deficit -72% stat penalty= final atk 2.750~ 
after the update: 7.000 base atk, at 32%~ deficit -62% stat penalty= final atk 2.750~
