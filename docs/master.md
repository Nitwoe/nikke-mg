# Introduction


**What is the purpose of this project?**

**Compile information about the game, process it, then present in the best form possible to any player interested. The guide is an eternal work in progress, and not all contents are covered at this moment, or at least, yet.**



**There are others already doing that, so why?**

The main objective of the project is not to dethrone or invalidate other guides and websites, it is something from the community, to the community. We will compile everything regarding NIKKE, and present it to you. This game has a lot of content creators, tier lists, guides, websites, sheets, docs... However most players don't even know the existence of the majority of them. That's where we come through.



**Why should I trust the guides presented here?**

Well... most of us are veteran players, from top unions across all servers. If you do disagree with something told in any guide here, by all means explain why, and point where the error is.



**Will there be a MegaGuide Tier List?**

Aside from the MLEM tier list, we don't plan to make one for character usefulness or strength. I will not say never, but it is something that we do not want to do. There are lots of tier lists out there already, one more is useless. 



**Now,** **New players**! **The early game will be overwhelming as the vast majority of content NIKKE has is unlocked in the first few chapters. Also, don’t just read this guide, read as many guides as you can, watch videos, you name it! More information you have the better.



**Veteran players**, if you want, go directly to the** **,**or**section.

# MLEM Tier List


**What is MLEM?**



*“**Thee** understand not ! Art thou nothing but a blinking fool. Allow me to open thy eyes and make **thee** understand. The mlem is just a way of showing **affection thee** say? Yet it's the purest form to reach someone's heart!” *

"The Mlemening" jimmiridimmi, 2024, p.420



*Only possible thanks to all the crazy lads in Prydwen!*

# FAQ:


## Goddess of Victory: NIKKE


NIKKE is a third person shooter role playing game. You are the commander of a squad of NIKKES -biocybernetic girls with guns- and you command them in actual combat, fighting an endless invasion of aliens called raptures.

**But it’s a** **gacha***, ***so let’s talk about rates, pity and Free to Play / Spender experience**. 

SSR NIKKES rates in all banners are a solid **4%**.** **If you play other gacha games, just by that you will be blown away, 1 SSR character every 25~ pulls is really generous.


If this is your first gacha game, 4% may seem low, it is in fact a quite high rate, compared to other gacha games. 

Along with a high rate, the mileage, a “pity system” of sorts, is amazing. For each pull you make, you receive a **ticket** that varies in colors: **Silver** from standard banner, and **Golden**, from special banners. Both types of tickets are **permanent** and are not tied to a specific event banner either. 

After you gather a total of 200 **Silver** **or **Golden **tickets, you can use them to buy a copy or duplicate of the Nikke of your choosing in the **mileage shop**.



On top of that, the currency you use to pull in event banners, **Rainbow Vouchers**are really easy to get, and you can buy them at any time, each at 300 gems… it may look expensive, but daily gem income is to the very least 200 gems! 



**However, I won’t sugar coat it. A gacha is a gacha at the end of the day. Will your morals crumble, and you will spend your hard worked money, or stay true to yourself as a F2P and suffer? Choose **wisely**.**








## Rerolling accounts


**Do you want to reroll? Or rather, does NIKKE require you to?** 



In my opinion?**Yes, it somewhat requires you to.**It is an endurance and mental battle. You will either burn out from rerolling or succeed before you do. 

If you choose to not reroll, keep in mind that after the first few months will be pretty rough compared to rerollers. Of course, you might not reroll and get lucky, who knows?



**If you plan to spend, you** **NEED** **to reroll.**



I will not make a reroll guide, you can follow  or  reroll guides. Both should be up to date.

## Duplicates matter in NIKKE? 


To answer this, I need you to answer a question.**Are you past the 160 wall**?**



If your answer is: **No, I have yet to pass it, **or even, **what is the** **160 wall**? 



It is a time gated wall to block your progress. You need 5 NIKKEs that are max limit broken, meaning, 1 copy + 3 duplicates, at level 200, to pass the 160 synchro level.

Read the**section if you need more information.



If your answer is: **Yes, I am past it.**

The answer is… **NO!** You do not need duplicates anymore.**Each extra copy is merely less than a 3% final dmg increase of that NIKKE.** **Duplicates add very little combat power, and aside from min/maxing ranking, regular players shouldn’t pull for more than 1 copy in any scenario past the 160 wall.

**However, getting 3 stars on any Nikke will reward you with her skill cutscene as a lobby screen, so if the waifu factor kicks in, follow your heart!** *Who am I to say something about your tastes, right?*

## When should I pull/skip NIKKEs? When is it worth it to use tickets?


Most of the time it will be as simple as: What tier is it? A / S- tier or below, skip; S+ / SS or above, pull. Anyhow, you can check the mega guide Discord for an early kit analysis written by us.



**But when should **you ticket**?** 

That's quite hard to answer. How many gems you have to spare, and on the same note, how many tickets can you afford to burn?



This is my opinion as a long time F2P: NIKKE “pity” is equal to **60.000 gems**. The time you need to hoard 60k gems is not small. I would only use tickets on **Limited (collab, summer and christmas) and Pilgrims.**

The only case I would use tickets on non-limited NIKKEs is when you fail to get them with pulls, and they are **SS+**.

## Do I need to change settings? Is there an optimal configuration?


**Make sure your game is running at 60 fps**. The GIF below shows where to change it. 





**Why should you run the game at 60 fps?**

**Machine guns(MG)**, **assault rifles(AR)**, **submachine guns(SMG)** **are affected by your frame rate**. Shotguns(SG) are also affected, but it's negligible. Sniper rifles (SR) and rocket launchers (RL) are not affected.

**The issue is, less fps, less shots per second**. It’s not really a major issue for desktops, but on the other hand, mobile players  might suffer from a not so strong cell phone. But fret not, **even if you** **can’t run the game at consistent 60 fps, the final dmg will **not change that much** unless it is locked to 30 fps**. 

Machine guns(MG) lose more or less 30% damage at 30 fps compared to 60 fps. 

Submachine guns(SMG) NIKKEs damage don’t come from their normal attacks most of the time, so it’s a negligible overall loss. 

*Update on SMG. With the release of quency2, that on top of being and SMG is a double/akimbo SMG, *

Assault rifles(AR) damage loss is minimal, 8% or less.



This is the sheet if you are interested. Actual important value in RED. 

**Actual DPS loss **depends on the context, but it will be a** **lower percentage than the RoF in any case.

**RoF = Rate of Fire** **does not mean** **DPS = Damage per Second**





**Battle Tab** will have several settings to mess with, **I advise you to tinker with it yourself and see what fits you better.** 

The only thing I would do is **deactivate** **the screen shaking**. It will probably give you motion sickness and make aiming a nightmare if activated.



All in all, these are my battle settings, feel free to copy.





**Aim assist can be a curse and a blessing. Certain stages require it, some stages do not. You will learn more about manual play later.**







# How Deficit Works?


**What **is stage deficit**? It’s a way for the game to artificially block your progress.**

Each NIKKE has a certain **combat power (CP)**, based on their: **Base stats, level, limit break, affection rank, recycling room bonuses, gear and overload attributes, doll or favorite item level, cube equipped and skill levels.** 



Almost every content has a CP requirement:

**Story stages, hard mode stages, simulation room, lost sector, towers and PVP.**

**Interception, Solo Raid and Union Raid** don’t have the requirement on display, but you need fairly good gear and synchro levels to clear them, so let’s say it also has a “requirement”. 



**But, why is that important?**Your squad total CP vs the stage CP requirement will dictate how much your team **stats will** get reduced. 

Thanks to , you can use this deficit . 

It shows not only how much deficit you are at, but also the **percentage of the reduced stats**.

## CP update TL/DR:


The CP deficit impact before was way less than now. Rapture’s HP / ATK / DEF remained the same, but how much our stats got reduced changed. The calculation goes as: Before, we had a bigger raw atk number being reduced heavily by the deficit, without OL atk being factored in. This means that at higher deficits we had **almost the same final atk or less**, but a way **higher base atk**, since synchro level was way higher. Now, since OL lines change the cp, we have a **way lower base atk**, but the **final atk** doesn't get as reduced as before, unless at a super high deficit.



The 48% deficit before, is 39% now. 

It's somewhat harder, and easier to push now. 



This is a example comparison of the same stage requirement before/after

before the update: **10.000 base atk, at 43%~ deficit -72% stat penalty=** **final atk 2.750~** 

after the update: **7.000 base atk, at 32%~ deficit -62% stat penalty=** **final atk 2.750~**

# Early game 


This section will cover **all content** you will unlock from the start of your journey through NIKKE **until you clear chapter 16 BOSS stage 16-28**. 

All this might be a little overwhelming, but I am sure you will do fine.

To have the best experience, I really advise you to just play at a slow pace and take your time to read the story. NIKKE's story is probably one of the best out there in the gacha genre.

## Oversimplified Team Building


I will briefly explain how a basic team composition -**squad**- works. This will apply to almost all content to some degree, however, **this is extremely subjective and individual**, as each player should have completely different NIKKEs on the start.

### Element Codes


As almost all gacha games, NIKKE also has an element system.**The premise is pretty simple: if** **a stronger element NIKKE attacks, she will do more damage. Aside from a very specific case in **, there isn’t any sort of penalty for being a “weaker” element, so don’t worry about it when building a team.**



**All NIKKEs and enemies in the game have an element code**. 

To verify what element your NIKKE is, **check the icon on the top left of the NIKKE portrait.**



You can check what element will have advantage in the** Enemy info **and / or** “weak point”, **displayed in all combat contents UI.
**Battlefield Info **will display all enemies that will appear on the stage, alongside their element.







**Burst phase 1 NIKKES **


You may use** N102.**She is a purple (SR) rarity Nikke that buffs your whole team attack, and you will probably acquire her when you do your tutorial pull. 



Only use SSR burst 1 Nikkes that have burst reduction skills over her, in order: 
Liter > D: Killer Wife > Rouge > Dorothy > Volume

 

Tia is a special case, as she **needs** to be paired with Naga, a burst 2 Nikke, as most of her skills need naga to be activated, along with another** burst 1 Nikke,** because her burst skill re-enters burst phase 1. If you use Tia as the only burst 1 in your team, you will not be able to do a full burst.**The same applies to Alice: wonderland bunny and Rupee: Winter Shopper; **they cannot be used as the only burst 1 either.


**Burst phase 2 NIKKES **



**Anis **is the standard pick. Very few burst 2 Nikkes are as good as her in the early game. Only swap her for Nikkes of tier A or higher, with a 20 second cooldown burst skill. 

With the exception of **Blanc, **which **needs** to be paired with** Noir or Rouge, **if not paired, she will have a 60 second cooldown, making her rather unusable**.**



**Burst phase 3 NIKKEs and Full Burst **



Your burst 3 Nikkes will be **Rapi and Mihara, **later being replaced by** **Privaty **and** **Alice** **or any other burst 3 you may get from pulls**.**

Ideally, you want to use a team with **one Burst 1 **, one Burst 2 ** and three Burst 3 **, **short for** 1-1-3.**Most of the early game is skippable without a healer, but it’s a good addition if you happen to get it nonetheless. 



**Burst cooldown and rotations**



Your squad **must have** a cooldown of 20 seconds, or to say, a burst rotation of 20 seconds. Burst 1 and burst 2 NIKKEs on your team must have a 20 second cooldown.



**Another thing to notice: When in auto-burst, the burst order starts from the **leftmost** burst 1 NIKKE, then goes to the right in **order, leftmost** burst 2 NIKKE then leftmost burst 3 NIKKE, which then your team enters full burst state for 10 seconds, increasing you damage output by 50%.**



Some NIKKEs skills reduce or increase the full burst time, examples being:** Mihara** that decreases the full burst time by 5 seconds and** Modernia, **that increases full burst time by 5 seconds.** **



**Full Burst  **



**The acronyms used for squad positioning: **

**P1 = position 1, the leftmost slot**

**P5 = position 5, the rightmost slot**

If you have 2 burst 2 NIKKEs in your squad, for example, **Anis(P1) and Centi(P2)**, **Anis will always burst before Centi** in auto-burst, unless she is on cooldown. 

What you want to do, is make the burst order of your squad at least auto proof:

**burst 1 in p1, burst 2 in p2, main dps burst 3 in p3, sub dps in p4, p5 can be anything.**

**N102 - Anis - Rapi - Mihara - Ether **is the non SSR squad I will use in the walkthrough.



**We advise you to seek help from the ** for a better composition based on the NIKKEs you currently own. This is just the tip of the iceberg about team building.**

## Game Walkthrough


The game tutorials are pretty good, so try to progress by yourself while using them, I'm sure you will do fine! Only come here to learn something about content you unlock, so as to not make any mistakes.



*Edit***: ***There was a complicated explanation about min maxing the early game here, but they added “free” level 200 NIKKEs to your campaign roster.*** **Even if it is ***just 9 uses per day***, **just** **that makes progression a joke. Early game “walls” are no more, and thus I had to create another account to see how it would impact progression… **Long story short, you can reach chapter 16 in 12 days if you try hard, instead of previously 25+ days even with a non rerolled account.**



But not everything is roses, **interception** and simulation **room**, where the temporary NIKKEs are not available, might be hard to clear compared to everything else, but then again, unlocking content will make your progression a lot easier anyway.**



**Chapter 0 and 1**



Tutorial and the game introduction. Follow the instructions, get used to the game.



**Chapter 2**



**The main objective now is to unlock the Interception, **the content that rewards gear.


That being said,** **DO NOT LEVEL SKILLS YET! **You **CANNOT **reset skill levels by normal means.**Until chapter 6 you can go with level 1 skills with no problem**. You will only level skill if you rerolled accounts, and your NIKKE is a damage dealer tier SS+.**
**
In stage 2-1, you will unlock auto shot, and auto burst.**Activate both by pressing the keys “Shift” for auto shot and “Tab” for auto burst**. While playing a stage you can check if they are activated **on the top left of your screen**.**They will turn orange if you activate them**.

Once you clear 2-4, a pop-up message will warn you an EX stage appeared.**Ignore it for the time being**, it is a permanent stage, won’t go away. You won’t be able to beat it for now, you need better gear to do it.

Next step is to unlock the . Clearing stage 2-6 will do so, go to the main screen and claim the free goodie.


Return to the main screen, go to your “Nikke” tab and **level your SSR or Rapi to lv 7, “quick equip” gear on her**. After gearing all the NIKKEs in your squad, you can go back to clearing stages. 


**Boss Stage 2-12** 



The first boss is Gravedigger. With the gear equipped and your main NIKKE at lv 11 it's an easy fight.**Prioritize breaking the QTEs (**circles**)** **and shoot it down**.**

Once you’re done, you want to collect the chapter .**It’s strongly recommended to collect** all the lost relics of any chapter you clear.



By now, you will have unlocked the **Outpost**.**Do not wipe out **yet. The reward  is based on your outpost level, **which scales with how many campaign stages you have cleared in total**.**Wipe out only  when you’ve finished pushing the main story on your first day**



The  is also open, do the tutorial, but don’t enter 1-A yet, we will do that later today.



You also should have unlocked the  and field missions already, you can skip them today, they are permanently available.





**Chapter 3**



A popup about temporary Nikkes will flashbang you, however **do** **NOT **use them while **pushing story** or tribe tower yet.**Each NIKKE has a usage limit of 3 stages per day, in other words, a total of 9 stages with borrowed NIKKEs per day! **Use just one when you can’t progress further for the day, to maximize your progression.**

There is no usage limit of them on **event stages, always use them there**. 

The only sad thing… they are **not available** for Interception or Simulation Room.



**3-3 unlocks the **, **come back to it when you clear 3-9.



When you clear 3-6 you will unlock the **. Ignore it for now, **but make sure to upgrade it **when you finish your day**, each level unlocks really good stuff, for example: **increase afk rewards from outpost defense, free synchro device slots, and lots more!**



To progress further you will need to collect all rewards available, your daily, weekly, day by day event… If there is an , do it too. You will see a lot of red dots in the main screen, collect everything, level your Nikkes and push again.



**3-9 unlocks **, you can also ignore it right now.



After that,  should be already unlocked, clear **1-A and try 1-B**. This is where you get **skill manuals**, commonly called skill books, and battle data boxes. 

You can open these boxes in your . 



Once you clear 1-A and 1-B, level up your Nikkes, equip them with any gear you have and go push story stages until you reach the boss.



**Boss stage 3-16**



If you have collected all the rewards available, you should be around level 21 with all your Nikkes. Pretty easy boss with that.



You unlock the**here, do your daily attacks with the same team you’re using to push story, it does not matter if you win or not. 

PVP is not something you can actually play yet, no need to go crazy about it until much later on when you have more NIKKEs and resources to spare.



**If you don’t plan to play for more than 1 hour on your first day, this is the time to do your Interception attacks and 5 event stages if there is one ongoing, then you can exit the game**. 

**If you plan on finishing the first part of this guide, use just one attempt, stage 2 is guaranteed, save the other 2 interception entries, we will use the attacks later.**



**Chapter 4**



Chapter 4 is a breeze, aside from 4-6, it’s one of the easiest. Remember to equip gear, level up your Nikkes and you will be fine.



**4-6, a “mini” Boss stage.**

**Meet Chatterbox, the Boss of chapter 6, yet a little nerfed here. Although nerfed, this Boss is still a tricky one.**



**At the start of the battle he will jump and target your NIKKE in the P3, you can press space/cover to avoid taking damage directly. After that he will jump back and stay still for a moment, **this is the time when you need to deal as much damage as possible to the parts circled in red on the image below.**Guided missiles will come from it, targeting the NIKKE he jumped to, the first time will be the one in P3, then it's random. You can cover or destroy the missiles, even if they don’t do much damage, if the same NIKKE gets hit 10 times by them, she will be instantly killed.**Never destroy the head! **If you do, he will enter a “rage” mode and damage all your NIKKEs per jump, and in rage mode he deals a lot more damage.**Only destroy the head if he has only a single health bar left, ensuring you will kill quickly enough.**
![Image placeholder]

**After you destroy **the parts on his back**, they will regenerate after a short while.**

**



**When you defeat him, **Shifty** will bait you with **. Skip the tutorial and equip the head piece you got, without upgrading it.**



**Now we need to use temporary NIKKEs.**Just slot in one borrowed NIKKE at a time, from 4-10 onwards.** Use Marciana** over your burst 2**, then Liter** over your burst 1**, then Alice** over Mihara or any other burst 3**. This is a cheese, without borrowed NIKKEs this much progression would be almost impossible on the first day.**



4-15 Unlock the **,** you can skip it until you unlock the **manufacturer towers on chapter 7, stage 7-13**.



**Boss stage 4-18**



Easy boss with an average level of 21 and borrowed Alice. Collect all the Lost Relics, as you will need blueprints shortly, and then proceed to **clear some hard stages to level your outpost just once**. After you’re done, **upgrade your Nikkes, clear simulation room 1-C **if you couldn’t before, **Interception D to the highest stage possible **with the remaining attacks, and **5** **event stages, **if there is one going on.



Now, go back to your outpost, and zoom out. You will see a couple of **+** **signs like the ones in the image below.
![Image placeholder]



Click on one of the **+** signs, choose any blueprint you own, and start building. Each building has a 5 seconds build time, and once it’s **finished, click on the building again** and it’s done. You will need to collect and use all the blueprints to upgrade your  to its maximum level. If you cannot build more, 



This is a reasonable time to finally stop on day 1. Reaching this long probably takes **up to three whole hours**.** I sincerely don’t recommend going further. 



**Day 2**



**The main objective is to clear Interception level D to at least stage 5, clear chapter 6, hard stage 1-2, t**ribe** **tower** to at least floor 39, and simulation room 2-B. Collect your outpost afk rewards, upgrade your NIKKEs and let’s get to it.**



**Chapter 5**

Uneventful chapter.**You will use borrowed NIKKEs at the end of chapter 6 today, so save the uses!**



5-3 unlocks the . Clear the first sector to receive a cube. Give the cube to your best burst 3 NIKKE.


5-10 unlock the , you can read the section later, keep pushing


5-15 is a dps check against healers and a shield boss, if you struggle, use **borrowed marciana here**



**Boss stage 5-20 Land **Eater **use borrowed** Alice here**. Alice makes the boss go down in less than 15 seconds, you can ignore the mechanics…**
**

5-20 unlocks , time gated free SSR NIKKEs!



**Chapter 6**

Boring chapter, even story wise. This one might get hard, if you can’t clear it on the second day just wait for the next day.

6-4 unlocks**and **.**This is a limited monthly event, if you can’t find theicon on your main screen, means that a solo raid isn’t active. 



**6-6A-2 is a defense battle that has tanky healers and Tiaras.** without borrowing a NIKKE.**



From **6-18, **you can choose to use** **borrowed units **or not. Each stage you do not use, is another chapter 7 clear today. Only use them if you struggle. 



**Boss Stage 6-24 Chatterbox, **same mechanics as 4-6, use **Alice**



**Day 3**



**Objectives: Finish chapter 8, hard 1-3, reach tribe tower 50 and the highest floor possible of any manufacturer tower available, as well as clear simulation room 2-C.**



**Chapter 7**



**7-13 unlocks the Manufacturer Tower. This is the time when you want to visit the ** section that was previously ignored.**



**The BOSS stage at 7-24 is Modernia, which ***was ***realistically impossible to be cleared on day 3.**

**Luckily, **now you can use borrowed NIKKEs**! **Use any of the 3 and clear it**.**



**Day 4**

**Objectives: **Finish chapter 9**, and unlock interception S. Simulation room 3-A, tribe tower to 60 and manufacturer towers to the highest floor possible.**



**Chapter 8**



**8-27 BOSS Stage Bow Tie **Use Marciana or Alice**



**Chapter 9**



9-12 is somewhat hard because of the amount of kamikaze raptures.**Use Marciana**.



**9-15 Unlocks **



**Day 5 to Day 14 and beyond**



**Your objective from now on is to **push story** until you finish chapter 16 and unlock Special interception or interception EX.**

**Remember to use borrowed NIKKEs if you struggle, it’s a piece of cake.**



**9-27 BOSS STAGE** **Doctor**



**10-25 BOSS STAGE Mace** 



**11-13** **



**11-27 BOSS STAGE Harvester.  **



**12-24 BOSS STAGE Material H.**

In Chapter 13, we will encounter 3 Tyrant bosses, as this story we will rematch against Modernia.**You will need to use borrowed NIKKEs on all.**
**13-15 mini Boss stage Alteisen 
13-18 mini Boss stage Chatterbox** **
13-24 Boss stage Modernia **



**And this is the end of the 14th day for me. If you used **borrowed NIKKEs**, you probably are way past this chapter already. Have you unlocked **? Check the guide for it!**



**And from here, you will face** ** and ho ho, there are a lot!**

# Game contents and guides


All contents available in NIKKE will be covered from this point on. You can browse all by the simplified table of contents below.


s


## The Main Screen




Or also known as the **main lobby**. All menus, events, and sub menus you can access from the main screen are listed below, with their respective guides or quick explanation.

### Day by Day




This is the new player event which is pretty common in all gacha games, complete missions for the day, and receive rewards. Once you finish all you receive a **SSR NIKKE, Privaty**. 

### Alice Diary




Alice diary is a limited event that rewards you with **Alice **when you clear chapter 11, and lots more rewards as the days go on. 

**It is a time limited event and unfortunately, ends on november 31, 2024**.**

### BlaBla menu




In the main screen, upper left, you will see the icon above. That’s your BlaBla menu, where you can find **field missions requests.**They reward you with gems, but even if the enemies appear in the map, clearing them **won’t count for your outpost level.**

**Another feature is to chat with your NIKKES!**

### M.O.G.: Memory of Goddess EX




I’ll keep it short, it's a really good **mini game **(vampire survivors style) that rewards you with stickers for your profile. I won’t spoil the fun, try it out!

### Friends and Union




**Friends** is where you can add… friends! Add up to 30, exchange social points  daily. Use social points to pull in the social point recruit banner. Reminder that the social point banner does not have pilgrims on it.



**Union** is a type of guild in NIKKE. I advise you to join one as soon as you unlock it.

Joining an active union is really important, since every month there is a**that rewards union coins, the currency used to buy 

## Events


If there is an event ongoing, it will always appear below the Campaign button.



**Event is a limited time story featuring the NIKKE of the current banner.**There are 3 types of events, and you can differentiate them by length:



**Regular/Filler events last for 14 days, and do not feature a special skin pass or map.**

**Special events last for 21 days, feature a special skin pass, sometimes feature a gacha skin, mini game(s) and a map.**

**Collab events last for 28 days, feature a special skin, always feature a gacha skin, mini game(s) and a map.**



**Regardless of what length the event is, all events have:**



**5 event stage entries, that refresh daily**

**Boss challenge, one entry per day. Pretty simple: You fight a boss in different difficulties, and receive rewards. Borrowed NIKKEs can be used here with no restrictions.**

**Mission tab, missions completion tied to event stages clears. Rewards include: Event lobby, a battery used in the event archive, and event currency.**

**Shop, with really good goodies**

**Record repository, to replay the event story and/or cutscenes** **

**Reward boost. When using NIKKEs that have the reward boost, you can win up to 100% increased event currency when clearing an event stage.**



**Example of a 14 days event UI**

**



**The maximum reward boost chance you can get is 100%, minimum is 60% if you only own SR NIKKEs.**

**That means, when you clear a stage,** you have at least 60% to a 100% chance **of receiving double the amount of event currency. The bonus doesn't apply to cases or first time rewards.**



Just like the campaign, the events are also divided in** Normal and Hard stages.**Total of 12 stages per difficulty. 

**Clear all stages, and after that you will **quick** battle the stage **1-11**, **2-11**, or **3-11**, depending on the highest hard difficulty available.**

**Stage x-11 gives the most core boxes, **while the other repeatable stages give less core boxes, credit or battle data.

**

### Event shop 


**First and foremost, **don’t buy entries for gems until the highest difficulty is available, you will notice that there will be more entries available for purchase. Only then, buy all entries, and use them on the highest **x-11** stage, that rewards 4 ** core dust crates per clear.**



**You will always be able to buy all the goodies in the shop after you use the extra entries bought with gems, so don’t worry and buy everything in blue.**



**Battle data set cases and RE-Energy consoles are only worth it if you are below synchro 160.**



**x30 core dust is what you will buy after everything is sold out**



**On the last day, after you bought core dust and still have event currency, you can buy the 2.000 credits. Even if you don’t, after the event’s end the currency is converted into credits and sent to your mail.**



**

## Shopping guides


Check out , and 



**Cash shop** is the place where you can **spend real money.**

**



**What are the best deals?**



**Supply Packs**

The best deal, for any player, is the **30 day upgrade supply pack, costing $14.99**. It’s the best value for resources in the game.
The **$4.99 supply pack** is also a good addition if you can buy it.**

B**efore opening your supply chest**, I advise you to just stack them in your inventory for as long as you can. The best choice is to pick either skill 3 book (middle right) or burst 3 (bottom right) to upgrade NIKKEs skill levels. Sometimes burst 1 (bottom left) is also a good choice if you already have 300+ burst 3 books.

*Note that this pack is just for game progression, if you want cosmetic goodies, you will want to buy the next pack***
**




**Seasonal and Special Skin Pass**



Normal events do not have special skin passes with them, however bigger events that last at least 3 weeks always have a **Special Skin Pass**. 


If there is one available,** **buy the event special pass over the normal pass**, since they give **Rainbow Vouchers** **instead of **Standard Vouchers.**Buying both is nice, but keep your IRL savings in check, they cost **$19.99 each.**

**

**



**Shop**

# Outpost




Your own city! Kinda of… This is where you will find most of the content that does not require you to fight. Let’s dive into it.

## Outpost Defense / AFK rewards






**This is what will make you push the story like a maniac.***Or is it because of the lore? Who knows!** *



* *

## The Command Center


**

This is the place where you will find stuff related to social interactions, music… and a **steady income of gems!**



**Recollection** is the menu where you can access and re-watch all the **story cutscenes** you have unlocked**, **brief encounters, that are the little stories you can see by interacting with the buildings you have constructed, as well as the:

**Event Archive:** where you can replay old events, which require you to spend a memory film -you receive one memory film from each new event you clear all missions- and collect some of the rewards, such as the **event music **and the** event special lobby**. You can also explore the event map and play minigames!



**Lost Relics** is where you can view the things you’ve collected from the story maps, once you collect a few of them, you will get gems as a reward. There is also a couple of lore inside each of the relics you grab, so if you like the story so far, be sure to read them!



**Side Story** **is the menu of… side stories. At the moment of the making of this guide, there are two available , and the first time you complete them, you get a nice frame and a couple of gems  too.



**Jukebox** **is where you can browse the game music collection, make your own ingame playlist! Collecting enough discs in a specific group will also reward you with gems.



**Advise** **is where you will bond with your owned Nikkes. You can daily advise the Nikkes of your choosing and increase your affection with them. You can also gift Nikkes with presents, increasing their affection more quickly. 

Each level will increase their stats by a tiny bit, and at bond levels 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 you unlock a special bond story with them! They will also reward you with 50 gems per story you unlock, per Nikke! 


The max level of bonding is tied to the numbers of duplicates. Acronym in **bold.**
Limit break level 0, **LB0,** affection max level=** 10**

Limit break level 1, **LB1,** affection max level=** 20**

Limit break level 2, **LB2,** affection max level=** 30**. This is the max level of **non-pilgrim** NIKKEs.

**Pilgrims only, **max limit break, **MLB**, affection max level=** 40**.



**Aside from stat gain, bonding with Nikkes past level 10 won’t reward you with gems or bond stories.**

## Tactics Academy




This is the content you **NEED **to upgrade **ASAP**.**This takes priority over everything, even above NIKKEs levels.**

Each class will cost credits, and you unlock really good stuff, such as: 

**Building slots, outpost defense income increase, synchro device slots, increased rewards from interception, and more importantly, upgrade your bulletin board (dispatch) to include**special dispatch missions.**

**  **

All tactics academy classes **have a **credit cost** and **additional requirement** to be unlocked, this is the list for them

**Class A-1: **no requirement

**Class B-2: **Train station, **chapter 3**

**Class C-3: **Generator,** chapter 4**

**Class D-4: **Hospital,** chapter 5**

**Class E-5: **Seed Club,** chapter 6**

**Class F-6: **Church,** chapter 7**

**Class G-7: **Shopping mall,** chapter 8**

**Class H-8: **Goddess of Victory statue,** chapter 9**

**Class I-9: **Fitness Club,** chapter 10**

**Class J-10: 11-27 BOSS**

**Class K-11: **Lesson 1 **13-1** , Lesson 2 **13-24 BOSS **, Lesson 3 **14-30 BOSS**

**Class L-12: **Lesson 1 **15-15 **, Lesson 2 **16-7 **

**Class M-13: **Lesson 1 **17-12 **, Lesson 2 **17-33 BOSS **,** **Lesson 3 **18-33 BOSS**

Class M is the last one.**Congratulations, you’re done with tactics academy!**

## Synchro Device 




The synchro device is available when you clear 4-15, but you will only need it when you unlock the manufacturer towers in 7-13. 

**Do not buy slots with gems**, **the tactics academy will give you enough.



Now, once you access the towers, you can do a little trick until you pass all tactics academy lessons. 


## Recycling Room




Time gated content. You receive console coins from events and/or AFK rewards.

Increase certain NIKKEs stats based on the console upgrade level and type. You can buy consoles from the .

Don’t be fooled tho, the increase is negligible.

**

**General research** consoles **come from the outpost defense AFK rewards and event shops.**Increase all your NIKKEs base health points.**



** **



**Attacker/Defender/Supporter Research** consoles ** ** **are obtained from events.**They increase the respective class NIKKEs base health and defense points.**



**



**Manufacturer Research **consoles ******are obtained from events.**They increase the respectives manufacturer's NIKKE base Attack and Defense.**

## Infrastructure Core




This is a forgotten feature of NIKKE. You unlock new things such as more arena entries, dispatch list cap, advice chances, auto dispatch, stamina +3 (Used on brief encounters in the **outpost**. You can check on the top left of your screen for this Each battery = 1 Stamina



**The only thing you need to remember from here is the free daily shop reset, **but after an update they made the reset button glow when you can reset it for free, you probably won’t miss it.

Again, sadly it's a forgotten feature. Unlock the free daily shop reset and you can also forget about this.

## Elevator / Liberation




More free SSR NIKKES! But they are not that strong 😢 *peak designs wasted!*

The NIKKEs available in the **Rehab Center** are **Guilty,** **Sin **and **Quency**.**It takes **exactly 60 days** to “liberate” the NIKKE of your choosing. 

**Pick based on looks!** 

Or if you want the “*stronger*”
**Guilty** **>** **Quency** **>** **Sin** 





After you clear chapter 20-31 BOSS stage, a new liberation target, **Nihilister** -*Dragon mommy to some*- will be available.**She won’t appear in the Rehab Center, unlike the other 3.**The GIF below shows how to access the “Upper World”. 



## Bulletin Board / Dispatch




Dispatch missions, send your NIKKEs on a daily basis to earn rewards. Couldn’t be more simple right? 

Well, It was until the addition of the collection items. *And of course RNG based! *🎉*Thanks devs!*



I hate this gem hellhole, so follow the dispatch guides of  or  until someone makes a guide for this here.

# Your NIKKEs




This is the menu in which you can check what NIKKEs you have, also known as the **NIKKE box.**

The option to filter is really complete, be it by** manufacturer, class, elemental code, weapon type, combat power(CP)… Use the filter to find the NIKKE you want more easily.**

**Check the image below, use the glossary to find stuff:**
![Image placeholder]

**Visualiser,** **Dolls,** Bond level,** **Recycling Room consoles,** **equip and upgrade gears,** **increase skill levels,** **equip cubes.**

**

**Visualiser, **one of the best features in the game**, **where you interact with your NIKKE! See if she has** skins, replay her** **voice lines**, check how her shooting position looks in the **shooting range**, **and my personal favorite**, interactive** **CHIBI Models**!**

**

**Also, something important you will use pretty often, are the acronyms for limit break, this is the list for them:**

**LB0 = limit break level 0**

**LB1 = limit break level 1**

**LB2 = limit break level 2**

**MLB = max limit break.**

**CORE + = core enhancement level**

******

## Leveling NIKKEs


The most straightforward way to increase your squad CP is to upgrade your NIKKEs level. 

**Each level costs** **Credits ** **and**  **Battle Data Sets ** **Level 10 and each level bracket after will cost** **Core Dust **

**What is a level bracket?**It’s a major combat power breakpoint per 20+1 levels upgraded, eg: 

**21 ➡ ️ 41 ➡ ️ 61 ➡ ️ 81…221 ➡ ️ 241 and goes on infinitely.**

To keep track of your leveling expenses and plan for the future, use the **progression sheet from **, it is updated regularly!**



That said, leveling is pretty simple, you get the resources and use them. Well, at least until the 

## 160 Wall


**This is the most hated “feature” in the game. Not only is time gated, it’s also… RNG gated!** 

Simply put, you cannot level NIKKEs past the level 160. 

**Does that mean 160 is the cap?**

**SR (purple rarity NIKKES)** **can’t go past level 160, however,** **SSR (Orange rarity NIKKEs) **can be leveled further, only if they are Max Limit Break (or MLB).**



Once you have **a total of 5 MLB NIKKEs level 200**, go to your synchro device and proceed with the tutorial. 

**After you’re done, congratulations! You’re past the 160 wall!**

## Level 200 and beyond


The 5 MLB NIKKEs get permanently locked to your top row in the synchro device, and leveling further becomes only possible through your synchro device. You shouldn’t individually level NIKKEs anymore, and put all of them into the synchro device.



### Credits issue


**Now I need to talk about the 281+ synchro permanent** **Credits** **issue.** This is related to the fact that credit cost to level up ramps up way too much compared to daily income of credits. 

**You can just solve that with boxes… right?**Let’s take a quick dive into math now.

The calculus goes like this: You are **synchro 305~**, chapter 32 all done, middle of hard 16, **outpost level 293**. 

Your daily income, 23~ hours of afk rewards, is **1.026k~ credits**. The credits cost to level up to 306 is **3.809k**. 

And so, without opening boxes, not factoring in events/dailies or any other credit income, you need to wait **90 hours, or use 90 ** 1 hour credit case, per level.**

**The thing is, that wouldn’t be so bad if you did not need to spend credits on gear.**

**The solution?**At the moment, there isn’t one. Some that are not definitive: Neglect upgrading gears, get more credit boxes with real money… this one really sucks. Have you found a solution? Let us now in our Discord!

### And yet, another core bracket! Apply to 350 and above


Synchro level 350 and above starts to increase **core** cost per 50 levels. Each upgrade costs 11.000 from 350 onwards until 400, that increase the cost by 1.000 cores once more.

**synchro 350 to 351: **11.000 **➡ synchro 400 to 401:** **12.000 ** and so on.**

## Gears and Collection items


Two types of equipment you can give to your NIKKEs, heavily RNG based. 

You obtain random **Gear** from **Interception**, **story rewards** and **missions**.**Alice Diary **rewards you with some gear too.

**Collection items** come from  and .**Alice Diary **also rewards you with Doll materials and a **SR Sniper **Doll!**

### Gear tiers and overload system


Up until gear tier 9 and “10”, there isn’t much to say, so let’s keep it short. 

You can check the gear tier and class by color and by the top left icon respectively. 

**Gears with tier 4 or higher** might come with **manufacturer bonus**, represented as the  icon on the top left of the gear piece. 

You can check your **NIKKE manufacturer** on the Console icons, if you forgot where that is, they are above your chest gear slot in your NIKKE tab:



**If equipped by a NIKKE of the respective manufacturer, the gear base stats increase by approximately 25%.**



**Gears tiers and maximum level of enhancement:**

** Gear of this tier cannot be upgraded**

**** Maximum enhancement level of 3, however it is not worth to upgrade any piece**

**** Maximum enhancement level of 4, it is only worth to upgrade the helmet piece to level 2**

**** Maximum enhancement level of 5, it is only worth to upgrade the helmet piece to level 3**

** **Tier 9 can also go up to level 5**, upgrading the helmet and gloves to 4 is okay, chest to lv 3 only if needed.**

** Manufacturer bonus tier 9 is quite different from the other tiers. Commonly known as T9M, short for tier 9 manufacturer gear, the acquisition of this gear is tied to** **, and certain bosses of the** **



**There are two ways to obtain T9M:** 

**1- Gear pity boxes**that drop since the first stage of Interception EX to the highest stage of Anomaly Interception. Collect 200 pity boxes and open it to obtain a single random T9M gear.**



**2- Raw gear drop:**

**Any Interception EX boss cleared to at least stage 7 **has a chance to give you a t9m gear. The chance is very slim, and increases a little on stage 8 and stage 9**.**

**Anomaly Interception has 5 different bosses, each giving different gear pieces.**

**AI boss, Kraken, is the only one that does not give any type of t9m gear**, and gives **custom modules** instead.

#### Overload system, tier 10


**To unlock the “tier 10” gear, you need a t9m gear, level 5, equipped by a NIKKE that activates the manufacturer bonus and a custom module (aka rock).** 

Keep in mind, the credit** **cost per piece of **tier 9** gear, from lv 0 to 5 is **1.592k**, and **6.368k** for **all 4 pieces, or to say, per NIKKE**. 

**Tier 10** credit cost per piece, from lv 0 to 5, is **2388k** and **9552k** total.



If everything is right, when you select the gear this  should appear.

When you get to this point, you will need **a Custom Module ** obtained in Interception EX (**SI) stage 9**, and any **AI stage**.

I won’t make an Overload in depth guide, as others already made them, and **compiled the recommended stats for each character**. Read all of them if possible.

**NIKKEgg** OL guides**:   

**Prydwen** **OL guides**:      

### Collection and Favorite items


#### Collection / Dolls


The **collection item system**, also referred to as the **Doll system, is a** **RNG fiesta**. 

**You can check**and**guides, both ***should** ***be up to date.**





**How do you acquire Dolls and Maintenance Kits?**

**Collection items / Dolls** come as a drop from , and from  the **doll “pity” box** of sorts. You get the box from **special dispatch**. 



**Maintenance Kits**, used to upgrade** Dolls**, also come from **Solo Raid** and **Special Dispatch**. 

**Overall, I advise to only equip R Dolls and upgrade them to phase 15 with only blue maintenance kits, then changing to a SR Doll.**



**



**Beginner Maintenance Kit ** **until R15 ➡ change Doll (SR5)** **➡  **Intermediate Maintenance Kit ** **until SR10 ➡  **Elite Maintenance Kit ** **to SR15 (max level).**



**



#### Favorite Items


Certain NIKKEs have a favorite item, or a possible upgrade after the **SR15 doll**. You will select one target to search for their favorite item on the dispatch system. 

**However! **You need to have the favorite item target at** **Limit Break 2 and affection level 30 to upgrade the** **SR15 doll **into the favorite item.** **If the conditions are not met, you will not be able to upgrade it, even if you have the maintenance materials.**



When the conditions are met, **you can instantly upgrade the **SR15 doll **into the favorite item** phase 1**, but to upgrade to** phase 2**, you need** 50 **maintenance materials, and lastly to** phase 3, 110 **maintenance materials**, total of 160.**



**Currently, there are 5 favorite items targets, from top to bottom, ranked by usefulness:** 

 **Exia** **is **the best** favorite item unit so far. After you are done with **most** of the priority targets for **SR15 dolls**, she is the get to go for Raids.**

**** **Viper** **might be short lived in the meta. She is **water**, an element that greatly lacks DPS. She will go down the priority if good water NIKKEs are released, but at this moment, she has uses in Raids that are water weak. If you can spare the resources to build her go for it, if not skip.**

****Laplace** **is actually okay, no Raid usage, but on **missilis** tower she is a good choice. Pick based on her appearance, if not skip!**

****Frima **also needs time to become useful.** **She buffs true damage, but we still don’t have “true” true damage dealers yet. She does not have any usage at this moment.**

****Diesel **if you want to push Elysion tower, you can invest her favorite item unit, as she never dies when full burst. She can be useful against certain bosses that need taunt such as Mother Whale.**

# Inventory, hoarding 101




**Rule of thumb for all players at any point in time: Always pick **Core Dust** over **Credits** or **Battle Data Sets**



**For skill manuals, pick the one you miss the most, but never **skill 2** or **burst 2** as you get a lot of them from event shops, you will have thousands of them in no time.**

**Most of the time, you will pick skill 1** or skill 3** and burst 3 ** **

**Burst 1 manuals**can also be an option, only when you have at least 350 burst 3 manuals stored.**



**When should you open supply crates?**When you can reach the next 20 level bracket. You can keep track of that with this 

# The Ark






**This is where you find all combat vertical content. This is also where you do your combat dailies.**



## Lost Sector


This is where you will acquire a new type of gear to your NIKKEs, **CUBES**. There are quite a few cubes to collect, each of them providing a new effect.

You unlock new Lost Sector areas by progressing in story mode and clearing boss stages.

### Harmony Cubes


Check  and  guides if you want.

The two main cubes you need to focus on are  the **Resilience Cube** ** **and **Bastion Cube** **.

You can get the **Resilience Cube** on **Lost Sector 04**,** which unlocks when you clear chapter 9.

The **Bastion Cube** can be found on **Lost Sector 07**, unlocked once you clear chapter 13.

**

**Does that mean all other cubes are bad?**Short answer:** Yes, all other cubes suck, with some exceptions**



**Get **Resilience** **to level 7 then** **Bastion** **to level 7. Once you are done you can choose which you want level to 10 first, and eventually to level 13+ both.**

**You can check the stats of each cube with this** , credits to the KR NIKKE community

#### PVP only cubes
If you want to be competitive in , you can upgrade Quantum Cube and Tempering Cube to level 7, but only after upgrading Resilience and Bastion to 10+. 


#### Quantum enhances the burst generation of Rocket Launcher NIKKEs (It works on all gun types, but aside from RLs, the burst generation is negligible) It makes your team burst faster, which is key in pvp. 


#### Tempering is good if you need one NIKKE to survive, usually the P1. You want to put it on taunters like Noah and Noise. 


#### Tempering Cube can be useful for certain units like Liter and Crown against Indivilia in Abnormal Interception since she deals more damage against Iron units. 


## Ranking


**

This is your Server Ranking. Not your main server, as Global, SEA, NA, etc.**But account creation time server.**

If you open your profile, you can find your account server right beside your name.



Here you can check your server ranking in various contents, the ranking of others in the same server, and earn **Frames** based on your ranking in various contents.

Check your **Frames **progress on

## Towers


**The “almost” infinite tower™ mode that all gacha games are legally bound to include.** Jokes aside, this is pretty simple. Each tower has floors/stages that are very similar to story mode. Clear one and go up one floor, rinse and repeat. 


There are some rules regarding the manufacturer tower, this is the comparison:



**The **Tribe Tower **is always open regardless of what week day it is, and you can clear as many floors as you can.**



**However, the** Manufacturer Towers **open only on certain weekdays, and you can only clear up to 3 floors per day on each. Another rule is that only NIKKEs of the same manufacturer as the tower can be used on them.**



## PVP Arenas


This is the ranked player vs player mode. Here, you can earn the Arena Exchange Vouchers  used to buy your **elemental code manuals in the arena shop. They are needed to upgrade your NIKKEs skills past level 4.**



We would like to recommend  and  PVP guides. If you don’t feel like immersing yourself too deeply in PVP, you can ask for team building help on any of the following Discord: , , , . 

Other players will gladly help you with pvp teams



This mode has a division on** Rookie Arena** and **Special Arena(SP Arena)** with Champion Arena coming somewhere in the future, which we’re going to talk about next.

### Rookie arena


### 


Rookie arena consists of 1 team with 5 Nikkes. You need to build an attack team and defensive team. Ranking is pretty simple, you earn stars each time you win against an opponent, more stars, better your ranking. If your defense loses, your star count goes down, and so your rank. 

You can battle 3 times for free without Infrastructure Core Stage 6 and 5 times with the upgrade at level 6. 



Any attack past the daily free entries, you need to pay 100 gems per entry. We don’t recommend doing that in the rookie arena, as you do not earn gems for ranking positions. 

The rookie arena season lasts for 2 weeks, and 1 waiting day in between season end and start. 



Everyday you will be getting a mail of daily rewards from the arena, and at the end of the season you will get an amount of arena vouchers for your ranking. 

Thanks to Keripo you can use his  to see what teams are used and what winrate they have against different team comps.

### SP arena


### 


### The first thing you need to take note is, it includes AFK farm of your arena exchange vouchers and also  currency that dictates one of your rankings. The AFK rewards will reach 100% in less than 24 hours, after that it will no longer stack more, unless you collect.


**You receive 2 free attacks every day **and more attempts cost gems. 

**This mode has **2 different ranks**, one based on your **battle rank**, which you can only increase by actively winning attacks, and the other from how many SP arena points you have. 

The main feature of this pvp mode is that you need **3 teams in defense**, but 2 for attack.** You can “ignore” the strongest enemy team and only attack 2, as you only need to win twice…**The best defense is a massive gap in synchro levels!**

The main problem is: **you need to have a lot of Nikkes, properly invested, in order to be able to compete here**. The best escapism that many chose is to outright ignore the existence of the SP arena. 

Each season of the SP Arena **lasts for 2 weeks** and has 1 day of waiting period until next season, same as Rookie Arena. 



**At the end of each season there is also a gem reward based on your ranking**

### 


### Champion Arena


This Arena is still unavailable, devs said to be released in September 2023. It's almost November 2024 and nothing but promises.

## Simulation Room


 and  guides



This is where you will get skill upgrade materials. Each difficulty comes with **recommended combat power**, that is more or less the CP you need to **quick** battle**. You can only quick battle if your squad CP is above the requirement, and the stage is not “hard” or “hard” Boss stage.



**Difficulty 2 unlocks after campaign Stage 5-1, gives Skill manuals 1 **and Burst manuals 1 **

**Difficulty 3 unlocks at chapter 8-6, Difficulty 4 unlocks at chapter 11-7, both give Skill manuals 2 ** and Burst manuals 2 **

**Difficulty 5 unlocks after campaign Stage 14-3, gives you Skill manuals 3 ** and Burst manuals 3 **





**BUFF Levels and legacy buffs nodes**

**Pick buffs based on this chart, top to bottom in priority**

**



**Even if they are not the same node type (triangle, square, circle or** **lozenge) chances are, Super Spec up appearance is pretty high.**

### Simulation Room Overclock


 guide



**Overclock **is sim room, but much more difficult.**You can choose what nodes you want, and each will increase the difficulty ratio, up to 50. All rewards are granted when you clear ratio 25, meaning ratio 26+ won’t reward you with nothing.**

## Interception up until late game


**Fight bosses daily for gear and upgrade materials. With the addition of temporary participation NIKKEs, Interception level D and Level S will not probably not be fought more than 10 times, as you will unlock Interception EX(SI) too quickly.**



### Interception level D Alteisen


**interception level D boss, Alteisen or Train** is the first boss you will have to face in interception. It is a pretty simple boss, destroy the parts and cover. You will probably only do this boss twice or thrice.

### Interception level S Gravedigger


9-15 unlocks level interception level S

### Interception EX or Special Interception (SI)


**Bosses rotates in this order:** **Alteisen MkVI** **➡** **Grave Digger** **➡** **Blacksmith** **➡** **Chatterbox** **➡** **Modernia** **➡ **Repeat**

**Each with the color of their respective weak element code. Videos for each boss have yet to be made, stay tuned!**

**All of them drop manufacturer arms** or gear “pity” box.**

**Drops are the same to all bosses, rewards only differ based on the stage cleared.
Stage 1 to 4: Gear up to Tier 8 
Stage 5 to 6: Tier Gear up to Tier 9**

**Stage 7 to 9: Tier 9 + chance of Tier 9 Manufacturer**

**Stage 9 also has a chance to drop custom modules**



**Until you clear chapter 22-36 the**will be locked, however, you have officially graduated from the early game!**

# BREAK HERE
# Mid game 


This is the time where you will just push story mode and clear tower floors at a very slow pace. You still don’t have gear to kill all interception EX bosses, and sooner or later will pass the 160 wall.

## Manual Play: Beginner to Expert


A video to be made in the future. This one will take a long while…

# Progression Walls


***Made possible thanks to KampretLordz, tio_romano, gatrix, itsmomoland, kisenix, awesome21snake and more!***



**This list will be updated as soon as new chapters are added or early chapters are revisited.**



**Up until chapter 18, borrowed NIKKEs can make the wall stages a joke. And as such, the wall only applies if you want to save the daily usage of them for a later chapter.**



**Criteria:** These stages are either stat walls, manual play required, the raptures are specially difficult to deal with, or a combination of all the previous. Bosses are generally “harder” than normal stages, however some bosses have very specific mechanics, and will hinder your progression by quite some time if you don’t want to learn said mechanics beforehand. 



**Do take note that all stages can be CP crushed, in other words, in a 10% or less CP deficit. This list will obviously not apply if not at least 15% deficit, with very few cases.**



The ones listed in **bold **are the hardest stages among the hard stages.

**List of Raptures that will hinder your progression


Servant Class

Bullwhip (seahorse): seahorse-like rapture, flying afloat on screen. Has a small hitbox so it's hard to aim. Hits you hard without warning

Starfish: Basically Bullwhip but even smaller.

Dagger: throws hitcount black ball. If there are too many, it will overwhelm your Nikke, especially if you don’t bring an MG. Introduced at Chapter 19

Kamikaze: there’s 3 types; Glitter (airborne), Remnant (land-type), and Capsule (airborne, element protected). Jumping to your Nikke, killing themselves. You will not encounter Capsule before chapter 25

Cube (volley): spams volley shots on your Nikke

Drifter: If you ignore, then they will explode. Dealing damage to all Nikke, can’t be dodged. Stuns Attacker Nikke (Supporter and Defender aren't affected). Auto mode ignores them so you have to aim manually.


Elite Class

Bronchus (fart): hit all your Nikkes with radiation attack (players called it farts), cannot be dodged. Overheal solves this attack

Glasses: you need to hit them hundreds of times to break its shield. It heals all raptures when alive. Need MG to kill it. Introduced at chapter 19

Launcher (silencer): it spawns Batteries that silence your Nikke, blocking Nikke abilities to burst. Introduced at chapter 23

Jellyfish: a jellyfish-like rapture as it names, binds 1 your Nikke, debuffs reload speed and slowly kills your Nikke. Introduced at chapter 21

Sentry (chain): bind your Nikke with a chain that stuns your Nikke for a long time if they are not killed. This rapture usually tanky

Barbell: a high defense rapture, Combine with healer it would be the tankiest rapture that you need to encounter, wasting your time. 

Joint (worm/inferno): A worm-like Rapture floating, damaging one Nikke after a long time, like Inferno Tower on Clash of Clans / Clash Royale

# Late Game 


This will be a pretty quick section, **as the Late Game is the stage between you reaching synchro level 241+, and clearing 22-36 BOSS, second time **Nihilister**, **and unlocking the new Interception, the**difficulty.**

### Mother Whale, Chapter 21 Boss


You probably did not have any real challenge, at least not up until now. Synchro levels or combat power won't solve this one. Meet the **Mother Whale**, the second hardest boss in the game. This boss **needs** you to play manually.


Profile
Class: Tyrant
Element: P.S.I.D (water), weak against electric
Range: Far

Pattern attack:

Spams bombs from port parts that debuff your DEF
Throwing massive projectiles to your Nikke. It can deplete your HP and your DEF. You can destroy the projectiles. To stop attacking, just destroy the port parts. 


Calling mobs.
When the core is still active, she roars, emitting Ultrasonic Wave that buffs all mobs' rapture to be **hitcount HP that needs to kill it with certain hits**. This attack occurs 3 waves of mobs (1 land based, 2 airborne). This mobs buff Mother Whale ATK so her attack will hurt your Nikke. 

At the first wave, she generates **Elemental Shield** that protects her, but it can be destroyed by killing all first wave mobs on the ground. You have to kill them fast, otherwise she calls the second wave of mobs and you are screwed.


A Mob receives only 1 damage per shot (courtesy: kampretlordz gameplay)

Destroying Mother Whale core (on her below belly on middle) prevents her roaring and buffs all rapture mobs, but the core is tanky if your Nikke is not invested enough.  If you want to play the rule, just delete the mobs fast.


Hurtle
This is just a basic attack, she is just rushing forward to hurt your Nikke.  just cover or generate shields to all your Nikke to protect cover.


Calling Elite-class mobs that could wipe all your Nikke. 
The most annoying attack. She calls Elite-class which is tanky and hard to kill. Then they will barrage all your Nikke. You can’t avoid this or kill them fast to prevent the attack. Fortunately, their attack can be attracted to one Nikke, so you can avoid being wiped out.


Elite mobs are barragging to random Nikke (courtesy: kampretlordz gameplay)


Second cycle
After doing such moves, she is going near, regens ports and doing no.1 attack again, then calling mobs like no 2 but no elemental shield in this cycle, but she will shoot Laser Shower that damages all your Nikke. 





Laser Shower (courtesy: kampretlordz gameplay)




What do you need:

AoE and/or Distribute Damage Nikke

Distribute damage is great because it ignores defense that is buffed because the mechanic says that damage will be distributed evenly whatever it takes. Mobs have too low HP so distribute damage can kill them fast.


Scarlet kills all mobs with her burst skill (Courtesy: kampretlordz gameplay)

If you bring Distribute Damage Nikke, keep in mind that she can’t wipe mobs when there is an elemental shield (except Electric code), because Distribute Damage works when it hits one enemy (on this, Mother Whale herself) then distribute it evenly to remaining mobs. If you hit Elemental Shield, the damage will be zero and distribute it as zero damage. So, you have to kill them one per one or wipe them with AoE burst. 

If you bring AoE burst, you have to wipe it fast before the mobs are being buffed because AoE attack is counted as 1 hit.



Dorothy is the best choice here because she deals distribute damage fast with her skill 2, then after 10 seconds when burst ends, the accumulated damage will be released to the enemy by distributing damage. You can try using Scarlet Black Shadow when burst, so let her burst at 2nd cycle when she calls the mobs (of course you have to kill 1st wave mobs). For AoE Nikke, there’s many options like Scarlet, Ein, Mari, Privaty Unkind Maid. 



Ein burst will hit 10 enemies on screen, Mother Whale calls 10 mobs first, so you can try her.



Taunter

Taunter here tanks Elite-class raptures attack (and to some extent, tanking spams balls), as their attack is unavoidable and could wipe out all your Nikke, but can be attracted to target 1 Nikke. These moves usually have to sacrifice your taunter so you have to run with 4 Nikkes for the rest of the fight.



Crown with manual play, Tia, or Diesel. If you bring Crown, you have to manualling her after Hurtle attack, so you can have 20 stacks when Elite mobs appear. About survival, if you can stack in the right time, she would not be killed because of her immune skill. Diesel (with treasure) can heal herself, so you don’t have to worry they would kill her.  


You can skip this if your CP is high enough, usually you will survive with cover destroyed.



Healer

Most of her attacks are unavoidable, so a healer is necessary for survival. You can’t wipe all the bombs that come to you, as you have to shoot the main body to deal damage. 



Blanc, Naga, Rapunzel are the best choices here. Blanc will give immunity to low HP Nikke. Rapunzel can revive 1 Nikke, you can use it to revive the taunter after barrage of Elite-class Rapture. Naga, paired with shielder (Tia), can help you destroy the core. 


## Elemental Damage, Elemental Shield


Elemental shield is a mechanic of Rapture that protects themselves from Nikke outside of their weak element. Rapture that is elemental protected is immune from any attack other than their elemental weakness, so the damage will be zero and their HP is not depleted, either from basic attack or skill/burst attack. For example, a Rapture of P.S.I.D (Water) element will not receive any damage from Water, Fire, Wind, and Iron Nikke until their Elemental Shield is broken or over. Only Electric Nikke (Water weakness) could penetrate the elemental shield. 



As introduced by Mother Whale, elemental shield will be commonly found on later stages in game, mainly in Raids. Unlike Mother Whale's elemental shield, which can be removed by killing mobs with any Nikke, elemental shields commonly can only be destroyed by shooting QTE with element weakness Nikke of that Rapture. This makes elemental weakness Nikke important for teambuilding in Raids. Furthermore, elemental damage is a crucial stat for later stages and Raids to deal massive damage on a Rapture. 



Why is Elemental Damage important? Because this stats is the most valuable in OL gears, as you can improve up to 116% by OL stats (29% per gear), then you will receive stats from cubes which improve your Elemental Damage from 8,48% (level 5 cube) to 19% (level 15 cube). This game gives so many numbers for Elemental Damage and it has separate damage calculation.



As default, your Nikke will receive 10% Elemental Damage bonus stat, then by improving it by cube and OL stats, you will receive up to 145% of Elemental Damage. These stats exclude the skill of that Nikke. Then in later campaign stages, Elemental damage can help you push campaigns in low CP. 

### Mirror Container, chapter 32 boss


The hardest boss to date. Has defense buff mechanics and parts that you must destroy with only 1 strong shot. If you ignore, your damage is just wet noodle or worse, only deals 1 damage per shot.

Profile boss
Class: Tyrant
Element: P.S.I.D (water), weak against electric
Range: Far

Attack Pattern

Fake glass slippers
He throws projectiles, target random Nikke. Just intercept or i-frame. Shooting MG, target highest ATK. After that, he summons fake slippers that must be destroyed by **1 strong shot**. You can ignore them and heal back or try to shoot it. This occurs 3 times. After that, He will call all fake slippers and do AoE attacks. Shoot QTE circles to cancel it. Then special interruption QTE. This attack usually take 1 minute, could be faster if you decide to destroy slippers


Glass slipper**

**

Spawns Glass Slippers to buff his DEF (Courtesy: Kontossis at YouTube)**

**He comes back, then **buff himself DEF 360% from the slippers**. This defense buff made your damage just a joke. First, he shoots a crystal that deals AoE damage. Then he will show slippers and go into attack mode. You can know slipper going attack mode when the slippers are glowing blue. Slippers must be destroyed by **a single strong shot. 
**

If you can’t destroy slippers, just shoot to stun him because slippers attack mode deals huge damage to your Nikke (not recommended if your Nikke is CP high diff). Repeat this 4 times until all the slippers are destroyed.


Harmony Cube: Destroy Mode
Going all out. Restore slippers to **Buff DEF again 360% with elemental shield**. Charging attack to kill all your Nikke. Can be cancelled by destroying QTE. 

So, do you think just shooting the QTE circle will cancel his attack?**well yes but you may only deal 1 damage per shot.**Remember that he just restored DEF, so your damage will be a joke again. Supporter Nikke like Naga was heavily affected because of her low base ATK and low buff. Even Attacker Nikke finds this difficult to kill circles. You can use Full burst mode with many buff skill to kill QTE or if your Electric Nikke has many attack buffs, you can destroy it.

After you succeed in destroying QTE circles, he just do no. 2 attack again. You have to destroy slippers again until the game ends.


What do you need:

Electric-code DPS
Obviously for optimum damage and to cancel his Elemental Shield. Note that you have to pick DPS because of his no. 3 attack pattern mechanic. You can try Naga with many buff but it’s not recommended for higher diff CP.

Anis: Sparkling Summer is the best choice here, you can pair her with any Electric DPS Nikke to support that DPS.


Sniper / RL
Remember that you have to destroy Glass Slippers in one shot, so non charged weapons are not recommended. Slippers will input 1 pellet from any weapon as damage, then it will be immune. Snipers, when charged, can deal huge damage in one shot.

You can imagine that Slipper's HP is 4 million, SG per shot deals 4 million damage, but it’s divided 10 as SG will throw 10 pellets per shot. Snipers could do 4 million damage for just one shot.


Healer (optional) 
If you want to tank Phase 1 slippers or AoE crystal, you might consider a healer as a companion. The best choice is Naga as she is Electric, too. 



The best Nikke against Mirror Container is Ein, as she is designed against that boss. She fulfills no 1 and 2 requirements as she is Electric code and Sniper. Her skill deals true damage so she ignores Mirror Container’s DEF buff.



**How to destroy Glass Slipper**



When he shows slipper, wait when it enters Attack Mode. Slipper will glowing blue and he is going backwards. You can see in the image below.
![Image placeholder]



Glass slipper attack mode (Courtesy: Kontossis at YouTube)

If you shoot it when off burst, you can just charge your sniper/RL and aim it to slipper. But this attack only works if your damage isn’t 1 damage, as off burst damage will be low. AI will shoot Mirror Container core when off burst so it’s safe to manualing


If you shoot it when full burst, you have to command all Nikkes to take cover, then you manual Sniper Nikke to aim and shoot. It is because when full burst, all Nikkes will follow your crosshair to shoot the target. You don’t want this other Nikke to shoot slipper then be immune, right? 

## Anomaly Interception (AI)


**Unlocked after chapter 22 is completed, or stage 22-36 **nihilister pt2**.**This is the current non seasonal endgame content. 



**Each boss comes from previous Solo Raids, with increased difficulty for non level 301+ players, because even if the level cap is 400, it’s not fixed like SR.**

**Is that a bad thing?** Well of course it’s bad, but at the same time **even stage 1 AI **clears** are better than Special Interception in rewards**. 

Another really cool thing is the**Custom Lock**, that you are sure to receive from any stage too.**They allow you to lock OL lines, 20 custom locks for 1 line locked, 30 for another one at the same time. Even if it’s just once, and you have to lock again each time, it’s better than to just lock with custom modules(rocks).**



**There are 5 bosses, each with the same set of rewards and specific rewards linked to their nature.**

**All of them are guaranteed to drop, since stage 1: **

**Tier 9 fodder gear, custom locks** and gear pity boxes** With the exception of **Kraken**, that does not drop gear pity boxes.**

**They also have the chance to drop 1 to 3 custom modules**per clear, based on the stage you can reach.**



However, the main gimmick about Anomaly Interception is that you can choose what boss you want to fight. 

**Click on the boss name to access a video guide about it.**

**Kraken** **raw custom modules and custom module pity boxes, does not drop t9m gear**

**Ultra** **drop helmet t9m and helmet pity boxes**

**Indivillia** **drop chest t9m and chest pity boxes**

**Mirror Container** **drop gauntlets t9m and gauntlet pity boxes**

**Harvester** **drop boot t9m and boot pit boxes**

**

**Sheet credits **to akusetsu**

**Guides every bosses
**Kraken**

The easiest boss that you encounter in AI. His main body is only still in the middle. His tentacle is the core. Punching bag boss at it’s finest



First phase

Destroy the front tentacle as fast as you can. If you ignore, he slaps all your Nikke. Tentacle is tanky, but fortunately, his front tentacle is a core, so you can deals bonus damage. His attack pattern will be:
- Tentacle slaps, twice
- Throwing rocks
- Elemental QTE
This attack occurs twice, after that, he will expose the core on the main body and dive. When he dives, special interruption.

Second phase
Same as the first phase, but his front tentacle will be squishy, but still need full burst to destroy fast. His back tentacle will shoot your Nikke so you have to destroy it, too. 



Team Building

Burst 1 and 2 will be Liter and Crown, then you can choose Wind Burst 3 Nikke as main damage. 

Sweaty: Scarlet Black Shadow with her assistant, Alice. Flex is Naga. If you bring Naga, you have to destroy all 

Boomer Finger: Scarlet Black Shadow with Sakura: Bloom in Summer. Flex will be Naga. you can try Noir as an alternative Naga and make the run less sweaty.


**Ultra **

This Ultra has a destructible core unlike campaign counterparts, so his core isn’t permanent (because dev knows this boss is too biased as Red Hood’s punching bag). Ultra just Ultra, he never moves so he is just a punching bag for Piercers Nikke. 

Pattern Attack:

Phase 1:

MG shot, target highest ATK

QTE (Elemental Shield)

AoE stun, can be blocked by shield

Spitting poison

This attack occurs 2 times, then he sheds his skin and enters Special Interruption

Phase 2:

Flings poison if the parts aren’t destroyed

AoE stun

Spitting poison


He will restore his core at phase 3, 5, 7 (need reference), so you may be sweaty to manage full burst for this. 

You can put all Iron Nikke as team building. The team consists of Liter and Crown as burst 1 and 2, for burst 3 DPS, you pick Red Hood, then choose between Snow White or Maxwell (which have higher Elemental Damage OL line). For flex you can pick Helm: Aquamarine to amplify your team damage. If you need survival, yeah you can’t put all Iron Nikke but Naga is a good choice for core damage.



**Mirror Container**

Basically it's the Mirror Container in Chapter 32 (read above), but easier. Core is permanent, so you can deal more damage. Fake Glass Slippers only 2 cycles. The most important is **he will not restore slippers to buff DEF 360% when **Harmony Cube: Destroy Mode.** 

**Team Building gameplay same as Mirror Container, Chapter 32 Boss. Ein with Anis: Sparkling Summer is your best choice against him. Burst 1 and 2 will be Rouge with Crown if you want to optimize Anis’s damage or just put Liter. Flex will be Exia with her Favourite Item or Naga.


**Harvester**

This spider will call mobs every time. These mobs distract your Nikke, every time. Mob attacks are kamikaze, so they will jump to your Nikke if you ignore them. The difference from campaign mode Harvester is this spider has a core on his head, but you need to destroy it first to access the core.


**Indivillia**

Hardest boss that you encounter in AI. Has an attack that is unavoidable, so your iron supporter which is the best (Liter and Crown) dies. Has highest base Defense stats, then she has many moves that can distract you from focus core.

# Raids


NIKKE Server ranking contents. 

**Solo Raid (SR)** is individual ranking, rewards vary from **gems, doll and cube materials.**Depending on your rank, you can also receive a **frame**. 

**Union Raid (UR)**, your union rank based on the clear time.**Rewards are only union chips** used in the Union Shop.

**Coop **is a cooperative raid with 4 other random players or a mix of your friends and guildies, **rewards **broken cores** used in the Recycling Shop**.**

## Solo Raid


**If you do not see this icon on your main screen, it means there isn’t a Solo Raid ongoing.**



This is a monthly “event”, which will feature a special BOSS (Tyrant-class) Rapture each time. Solo Raid has a total of 7 difficulties, and a challenge mode, each with increased difficulty and rewards.



**You receive 3 entries every day**.**Each entry allows you to utilize up to 5 separate teams to beat the boss. If you can clear all difficulties up to 7, then you don’t need to worry and just clear everything and then quick battle the highest non-challenge mode difficulty on the subsequent days. 



**First difficulty should be easy with synchro 41, and each subsequent difficulty requires 20 synchro levels more than the previous Synchro 160 with one or two level 200 NIKKEs should be enough for difficulty 7 clear.**



The event usually starts from **Thursday, the first week of the month at 12:00 PM UTC+9** (Seoul, Korea time) and lasts for a week, finishing at the next **Thursday at 05:00 AM UTC+9**. The challenge mode opens on the third day, because you only attempt three times a day.



**Solo Raid Team Building**

As mentioned in **Elemental Damage, Elemental Shield**, you have to build a team including at least 1 Nikke is element weakness of the boss, because you will encounter elemental shield. If you ignore the elemental shield, basically the boss will wipe all your Nikke. Even that attack didn’t wipe all your Nikke, you have to destroy it fast because you will deal too little damage and this mode needs you to gain a higher score with your team. 



Building elemental damage is necessary because elemental damage is the main factor to gain a high score.



Keep in mind that you need to learn the gimmick of bosses before building teams, because we don’t know how Shift Up cooking of the boss. You may encounter easy boss that you don’t need healer or you have to encounter hard boss that you need certain weapon / skill to counter boss gimmicks



**Challenge Mode**

The goal is to deal as much damage you can to the boss with 5 separate teams. The level of Nikkes are fixed to level 400 regardless of your current level. The main factor to get a higher score is your NIKKEs investment. 


After you finish attacking with five teams on Challenge Mode, the total score is the same as the total damage dealt by each team combined. It will be put on the leaderboard of each server, and show your rank percentage or position on the top 200. You can brag about it to your friends. Then, you can get gems and frames. The higher score you gain, the more gems you will get, and a better frame.



This is the real Endgame content that Nikke provides for now. Basically, your invested Nikkes are going to be used in Solo Raid Challenge Mode or SP Arena PvP. Pushing hard stages is basically time gated by synchro levels.

## Union Raid


Same as Solo Raid, Union Raid is a monthly event. Your Union will encounter 5 types of Raptures (3 Lord-class, 2 Tyrant-class). These bosses need to be killed 10 times each with all your Union members.



Each member receives 3 attempts per day. You can choose the boss that uses your attempt to attack.



You need to coordinate with your union member to get optimum clear time, something difficult in casual or semi casual unions.



Starts from on the **Friday, third/fourth week of month at 12:00 PM UTC+9** (Korean Time) until **Thursday, a week later at 05:00 AM UTC+9**



This mode is just a speedrun competition if you aim for higher ranks and piloting accounts will be necessary for some Unions, especially competitive ones.

## Coop


Time limited operation, with friends or randoms. Unfortunately, the UI for coop is pretty outdated, and you won’t even see it if you don’t look for it.

It will appear on the cards below your commander icon and on the 



Pretty simple mode, and negligible ranking rewards. Most of the time, you will go AFK and just wait for the battle timer to run out. Simply participating is enough to receive all rewards needed to buy everything on the Recycling Shop.

# Endless End Game 


Tired? At least, we are! 

After all we’re covered, there is only one thing left to do.



## Hard Stages to the Moon


A

**Tyrant-class Boss Tier List**







Very Easy: Generic attack (laser, projectiles, interceptable AoE attack), Usually no need healer to do good run. Canceling their gimmicks usually disables them completely. Basically punching bag Rapture. Auto friendly, you need manual aim to shoot QTE circles. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with 1 element strongest included.

Easy: Generic attack, boss is punching bag but has 1 gimmick that can’t be disabled, but can be dodged. Suggested to bring healer against this boss, but it’s okay if not especially if the attack is cover dependent. Auto friendly, you need manual aim to shoot QTE circles. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with element strongest included.

Medium: Generic attack, Has gimmicks that could be annoying but manageable. Bring healer or cover repair to solve the gimmick. Not auto friendly. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with element strongest included.

Hard: has 1-2 annoying gimmick skills that need some treatment. Healer is necessary to deal with their gimmicks. Do unavoidable attacks that hurt your Nikke. Not Auto friendly. Can run a generic team, but suggested bringing certain Nikke to deal with their gimmick for easier run.

Very Hard: has many gimmick attacks that you have to run a certain Nikke to deal with. Even if your Nikke level is higher, they can kill you if you don’t know how to deal with it. Not auto friendly (obviously). Certain Nikke is needed to deal with this kind of Rapture.
