# Late Game 


This will be a pretty quick section, **as the Late Game is the stage between you reaching synchro level 241+, and clearing 22-36 BOSS, second time **Nihilister**, **and unlocking the new Interception, the**difficulty.**

### Mother Whale, Chapter 21 Boss


You probably did not have any real challenge, at least not up until now. Synchro levels or combat power won't solve this one. Meet the **Mother Whale**, the second hardest boss in the game. This boss **needs** you to play manually.


Profile
Class: Tyrant
Element: P.S.I.D (water), weak against electric
Range: Far

Pattern attack:

Spams bombs from port parts that debuff your DEF
Throwing massive projectiles to your Nikke. It can deplete your HP and your DEF. You can destroy the projectiles. To stop attacking, just destroy the port parts. 


Calling mobs.
When the core is still active, she roars, emitting Ultrasonic Wave that buffs all mobs' rapture to be **hitcount HP that needs to kill it with certain hits**. This attack occurs 3 waves of mobs (1 land based, 2 airborne). This mobs buff Mother Whale ATK so her attack will hurt your Nikke. 

At the first wave, she generates **Elemental Shield** that protects her, but it can be destroyed by killing all first wave mobs on the ground. You have to kill them fast, otherwise she calls the second wave of mobs and you are screwed.

Destroying Mother Whale core (on her below belly on middle) prevents her roaring and buffs all rapture mobs, but the core is tanky if your Nikke is not invested enough.  If you want to play the rule, just delete the mobs fast.


Hurtle
This is just a basic attack, she is just rushing forward to hurt your Nikke.  just cover or generate shields to all your Nikke to protect cover.


Calling Elite-class mobs that could wipe all your Nikke. 
The most annoying attack. She calls Elite-class which is tanky and hard to kill. Then they will barrage all your Nikke. You can’t avoid this or kill them fast to prevent the attack. Fortunately, their attack can be attracted to one Nikke, so you can avoid being wiped out.

Second cycle
After doing such moves, she is going near, regens ports and doing no.1 attack again, then calling mobs like no 2 but no elemental shield in this cycle, but she will shoot Laser Shower that damages all your Nikke.

What do you need:

AoE and/or Distribute Damage Nikke

Distribute damage is great because it ignores defense that is buffed because the mechanic says that damage will be distributed evenly whatever it takes. Mobs have too low HP so distribute damage can kill them fast.


Scarlet kills all mobs with her burst skill (Courtesy: kampretlordz gameplay)

If you bring Distribute Damage Nikke, keep in mind that she can’t wipe mobs when there is an elemental shield (except Electric code), because Distribute Damage works when it hits one enemy (on this, Mother Whale herself) then distribute it evenly to remaining mobs. If you hit Elemental Shield, the damage will be zero and distribute it as zero damage. So, you have to kill them one per one or wipe them with AoE burst. 

If you bring AoE burst, you have to wipe it fast before the mobs are being buffed because AoE attack is counted as 1 hit.



Dorothy is the best choice here because she deals distribute damage fast with her skill 2, then after 10 seconds when burst ends, the accumulated damage will be released to the enemy by distributing damage. You can try using Scarlet Black Shadow when burst, so let her burst at 2nd cycle when she calls the mobs (of course you have to kill 1st wave mobs). For AoE Nikke, there’s many options like Scarlet, Ein, Mari, Privaty Unkind Maid. 



Ein burst will hit 10 enemies on screen, Mother Whale calls 10 mobs first, so you can try her.



Taunter

Taunter here tanks Elite-class raptures attack (and to some extent, tanking spams balls), as their attack is unavoidable and could wipe out all your Nikke, but can be attracted to target 1 Nikke. These moves usually have to sacrifice your taunter so you have to run with 4 Nikkes for the rest of the fight.



Crown with manual play, Tia, or Diesel. If you bring Crown, you have to manualling her after Hurtle attack, so you can have 20 stacks when Elite mobs appear. About survival, if you can stack in the right time, she would not be killed because of her immune skill. Diesel (with treasure) can heal herself, so you don’t have to worry they would kill her.  


You can skip this if your CP is high enough, usually you will survive with cover destroyed.



Healer

Most of her attacks are unavoidable, so a healer is necessary for survival. You can’t wipe all the bombs that come to you, as you have to shoot the main body to deal damage. 



Blanc, Naga, Rapunzel are the best choices here. Blanc will give immunity to low HP Nikke. Rapunzel can revive 1 Nikke, you can use it to revive the taunter after barrage of Elite-class Rapture. Naga, paired with shielder (Tia), can help you destroy the core. 


## Elemental Damage, Elemental Shield


Elemental shield is a mechanic of Rapture that protects themselves from Nikke outside of their weak element. Rapture that is elemental protected is immune from any attack other than their elemental weakness, so the damage will be zero and their HP is not depleted, either from basic attack or skill/burst attack. For example, a Rapture of P.S.I.D (Water) element will not receive any damage from Water, Fire, Wind, and Iron Nikke until their Elemental Shield is broken or over. Only Electric Nikke (Water weakness) could penetrate the elemental shield. 



As introduced by Mother Whale, elemental shield will be commonly found on later stages in game, mainly in Raids. Unlike Mother Whale's elemental shield, which can be removed by killing mobs with any Nikke, elemental shields commonly can only be destroyed by shooting QTE with element weakness Nikke of that Rapture. This makes elemental weakness Nikke important for teambuilding in Raids. Furthermore, elemental damage is a crucial stat for later stages and Raids to deal massive damage on a Rapture. 



Why is Elemental Damage important? Because this stats is the most valuable in OL gears, as you can improve up to 116% by OL stats (29% per gear), then you will receive stats from cubes which improve your Elemental Damage from 8,48% (level 5 cube) to 19% (level 15 cube). This game gives so many numbers for Elemental Damage and it has separate damage calculation.



As default, your Nikke will receive 10% Elemental Damage bonus stat, then by improving it by cube and OL stats, you will receive up to 145% of Elemental Damage. These stats exclude the skill of that Nikke. Then in later campaign stages, Elemental damage can help you push campaigns in low CP. 

### Mirror Container, chapter 32 boss


The hardest boss to date. Has defense buff mechanics and parts that you must destroy with only 1 strong shot. If you ignore, your damage is just wet noodle or worse, only deals 1 damage per shot.

Profile boss
Class: Tyrant
Element: P.S.I.D (water), weak against electric
Range: Far

Attack Pattern

Fake glass slippers
He throws projectiles, target random Nikke. Just intercept or i-frame. Shooting MG, target highest ATK. After that, he summons fake slippers that must be destroyed by **1 strong shot**. You can ignore them and heal back or try to shoot it. This occurs 3 times. After that, He will call all fake slippers and do AoE attacks. Shoot QTE circles to cancel it. Then special interruption QTE. This attack usually take 1 minute, could be faster if you decide to destroy slippers


Glass slipper**

**

Spawns Glass Slippers to buff his DEF (Courtesy: Kontossis at YouTube)**

**He comes back, then **buff himself DEF 360% from the slippers**. This defense buff made your damage just a joke. First, he shoots a crystal that deals AoE damage. Then he will show slippers and go into attack mode. You can know slipper going attack mode when the slippers are glowing blue. Slippers must be destroyed by **a single strong shot. 
**

If you can’t destroy slippers, just shoot to stun him because slippers attack mode deals huge damage to your Nikke (not recommended if your Nikke is CP high diff). Repeat this 4 times until all the slippers are destroyed.


Harmony Cube: Destroy Mode
Going all out. Restore slippers to **Buff DEF again 360% with elemental shield**. Charging attack to kill all your Nikke. Can be cancelled by destroying QTE. 

So, do you think just shooting the QTE circle will cancel his attack?**well yes but you may only deal 1 damage per shot.**Remember that he just restored DEF, so your damage will be a joke again. Supporter Nikke like Naga was heavily affected because of her low base ATK and low buff. Even Attacker Nikke finds this difficult to kill circles. You can use Full burst mode with many buff skill to kill QTE or if your Electric Nikke has many attack buffs, you can destroy it.

After you succeed in destroying QTE circles, he just do no. 2 attack again. You have to destroy slippers again until the game ends.


What do you need:

Electric-code DPS
Obviously for optimum damage and to cancel his Elemental Shield. Note that you have to pick DPS because of his no. 3 attack pattern mechanic. You can try Naga with many buff but it’s not recommended for higher diff CP.

Anis: Sparkling Summer is the best choice here, you can pair her with any Electric DPS Nikke to support that DPS.


Sniper / RL
Remember that you have to destroy Glass Slippers in one shot, so non charged weapons are not recommended. Slippers will input 1 pellet from any weapon as damage, then it will be immune. Snipers, when charged, can deal huge damage in one shot.

You can imagine that Slipper's HP is 4 million, SG per shot deals 4 million damage, but it’s divided 10 as SG will throw 10 pellets per shot. Snipers could do 4 million damage for just one shot.


Healer (optional) 
If you want to tank Phase 1 slippers or AoE crystal, you might consider a healer as a companion. The best choice is Naga as she is Electric, too. 



The best Nikke against Mirror Container is Ein, as she is designed against that boss. She fulfills no 1 and 2 requirements as she is Electric code and Sniper. Her skill deals true damage so she ignores Mirror Container’s DEF buff.



**How to destroy Glass Slipper**



When he shows slipper, wait when it enters Attack Mode. Slipper will glowing blue and he is going backwards. You can see in the image below.
![Image placeholder]



Glass slipper attack mode (Courtesy: Kontossis at YouTube)

If you shoot it when off burst, you can just charge your sniper/RL and aim it to slipper. But this attack only works if your damage isn’t 1 damage, as off burst damage will be low. AI will shoot Mirror Container core when off burst so it’s safe to manualing


If you shoot it when full burst, you have to command all Nikkes to take cover, then you manual Sniper Nikke to aim and shoot. It is because when full burst, all Nikkes will follow your crosshair to shoot the target. You don’t want this other Nikke to shoot slipper then be immune, right? 

## Anomaly Interception (AI)


**Unlocked after chapter 22 is completed, or stage 22-36 **nihilister pt2**.**This is the current non seasonal endgame content. 



**Each boss comes from previous Solo Raids, with increased difficulty for non level 301+ players, because even if the level cap is 400, it’s not fixed like SR.**

**Is that a bad thing?** Well of course it’s bad, but at the same time **even stage 1 AI **clears** are better than Special Interception in rewards**. 

Another really cool thing is the**Custom Lock**, that you are sure to receive from any stage too.**They allow you to lock OL lines, 20 custom locks for 1 line locked, 30 for another one at the same time. Even if it’s just once, and you have to lock again each time, it’s better than to just lock with custom modules(rocks).**



**There are 5 bosses, each with the same set of rewards and specific rewards linked to their nature.**

**All of them are guaranteed to drop, since stage 1: **

**Tier 9 fodder gear, custom locks** and gear pity boxes** With the exception of **Kraken**, that does not drop gear pity boxes.**

**They also have the chance to drop 1 to 3 custom modules**per clear, based on the stage you can reach.**



However, the main gimmick about Anomaly Interception is that you can choose what boss you want to fight. 

**Click on the boss name to access a video guide about it.**

**Kraken** **raw custom modules and custom module pity boxes, does not drop t9m gear**

**Ultra** **drop helmet t9m and helmet pity boxes**

**Indivillia** **drop chest t9m and chest pity boxes**

**Mirror Container** **drop gauntlets t9m and gauntlet pity boxes**

**Harvester** **drop boot t9m and boot pit boxes**

**Kraken**

The easiest boss that you encounter in AI. His main body is only still in the middle. His tentacle is the core. Punching bag boss at it’s finest



First phase

Destroy the front tentacle as fast as you can. If you ignore, he slaps all your Nikke. Tentacle is tanky, but fortunately, his front tentacle is a core, so you can deals bonus damage. His attack pattern will be:
- Tentacle slaps, twice
- Throwing rocks
- Elemental QTE
This attack occurs twice, after that, he will expose the core on the main body and dive. When he dives, special interruption.

Second phase
Same as the first phase, but his front tentacle will be squishy, but still need full burst to destroy fast. His back tentacle will shoot your Nikke so you have to destroy it, too. 



Team Building

Burst 1 and 2 will be Liter and Crown, then you can choose Wind Burst 3 Nikke as main damage. 

Sweaty: Scarlet Black Shadow with her assistant, Alice. Flex is Naga. If you bring Naga, you have to destroy all 

Boomer Finger: Scarlet Black Shadow with Sakura: Bloom in Summer. Flex will be Naga. you can try Noir as an alternative Naga and make the run less sweaty.


**Ultra **

This Ultra has a destructible core unlike campaign counterparts, so his core isn’t permanent (because dev knows this boss is too biased as Red Hood’s punching bag). Ultra just Ultra, he never moves so he is just a punching bag for Piercers Nikke. 

Pattern Attack:

Phase 1:

MG shot, target highest ATK

QTE (Elemental Shield)

AoE stun, can be blocked by shield

Spitting poison

This attack occurs 2 times, then he sheds his skin and enters Special Interruption

Phase 2:

Flings poison if the parts aren’t destroyed

AoE stun

Spitting poison


He will restore his core at phase 3, 5, 7 (need reference), so you may be sweaty to manage full burst for this. 

You can put all Iron Nikke as team building. The team consists of Liter and Crown as burst 1 and 2, for burst 3 DPS, you pick Red Hood, then choose between Snow White or Maxwell (which have higher Elemental Damage OL line). For flex you can pick Helm: Aquamarine to amplify your team damage. If you need survival, yeah you can’t put all Iron Nikke but Naga is a good choice for core damage.



**Mirror Container**

Basically it's the Mirror Container in Chapter 32 (read above), but easier. Core is permanent, so you can deal more damage. Fake Glass Slippers only 2 cycles. The most important is **he will not restore slippers to buff DEF 360% when **Harmony Cube: Destroy Mode.** 

**Team Building gameplay same as Mirror Container, Chapter 32 Boss. Ein with Anis: Sparkling Summer is your best choice against him. Burst 1 and 2 will be Rouge with Crown if you want to optimize Anis’s damage or just put Liter. Flex will be Exia with her Favourite Item or Naga.


**Harvester**

This spider will call mobs every time. These mobs distract your Nikke, every time. Mob attacks are kamikaze, so they will jump to your Nikke if you ignore them. The difference from campaign mode Harvester is this spider has a core on his head, but you need to destroy it first to access the core.


**Indivillia**

Hardest boss that you encounter in AI. Has an attack that is unavoidable, so your iron supporter which is the best (Liter and Crown) dies. Has highest base Defense stats, then she has many moves that can distract you from focus core.
