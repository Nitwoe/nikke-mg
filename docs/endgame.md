Tired? At least, we are! 

After all we’re covered, there is only one thing left to do.



## Hard Stages to the Moon


A

**Tyrant-class Boss Tier List**







Very Easy: Generic attack (laser, projectiles, interceptable AoE attack), Usually no need healer to do good run. Canceling their gimmicks usually disables them completely. Basically punching bag Rapture. Auto friendly, you need manual aim to shoot QTE circles. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with 1 element strongest included.

Easy: Generic attack, boss is punching bag but has 1 gimmick that can’t be disabled, but can be dodged. Suggested to bring healer against this boss, but it’s okay if not especially if the attack is cover dependent. Auto friendly, you need manual aim to shoot QTE circles. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with element strongest included.

Medium: Generic attack, Has gimmicks that could be annoying but manageable. Bring healer or cover repair to solve the gimmick. Not auto friendly. Can run with generic team (all weapons) with element strongest included.

Hard: has 1-2 annoying gimmick skills that need some treatment. Healer is necessary to deal with their gimmicks. Do unavoidable attacks that hurt your Nikke. Not Auto friendly. Can run a generic team, but suggested bringing certain Nikke to deal with their gimmick for easier run.

Very Hard: has many gimmick attacks that you have to run a certain Nikke to deal with. Even if your Nikke level is higher, they can kill you if you don’t know how to deal with it. Not auto friendly (obviously). Certain Nikke is needed to deal with this kind of Rapture.
