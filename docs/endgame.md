# **Endless End Game**  

Tired? At least, we are!   
After all we’re covered, there is only one thing left to do

## **Hard Stages, to the Moon!** 

Normal stages, with “hard” on the name!.  
They are the same stages as their normal counterparts, the only difference is the increased combat power requirement.   
As of november/24, Hard Stage 34-38 Boss is the highest stage available, cleared at synchro 521 by some amazing players.  
Most hard stage clears are posted on youtube, simply by searching the stage x-x, you should probably find a few.

The MegaGuide [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nikkemegaguide) also has some hard stage clears, go check it out!
